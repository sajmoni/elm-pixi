# elm-pixi

- All logic is handled by Elm. 
- Rendering is done in JavaScript with pixi.js. 
- Elm communicates with pixi through ports.

This library intends to use the best parts of Elm and Pixi. It enables you to write code that takes advantage
of Elms compiler and type system. It does not do anything to guarantee good performance though. Use at your own risk.
